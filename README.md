# AI-based Medical Imaging & Report Platform

This project is an AI-powered medical imaging tool built using Python. It allows users to upload medical images (like DICOM files), processes them using a trained deep learning model, and generates basic diagnostic reports.

##  Features

-  Load and view medical images (DICOM format)
-  AI-based image classification using TensorFlow
-  Automated report generation
-  Display analysis results using Matplotlib

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- pydicom
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Add Your DICOM Image
Place your .dcm file in the project directory.

2. Run the Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python "AI-based Medical & Report Platform.py"

## Output
The script will display the medical image.

It will classify the image using a dummy (or pre-trained) model.

A report will be printed in the terminal and optionally saved as a .txt file.
